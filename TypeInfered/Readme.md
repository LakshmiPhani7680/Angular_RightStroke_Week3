Develop a program that exhibits inferred typing in Angular?




Answer:
      Since TypeScript entities have data types associated with them, 
      the TypeScript compiler can guess the type of the data based on the type or value that is assigned to a variable. 
      The automatic association of the type to a variable, function parameter, functions, etc. 
      according to the value of it is called type inference.
      
      
      
      
      
      ex: let t= 1;
      
      
      
      
      
      Explaination:
             Then the TypeScript compiler automatically knows that t is a number. It can deal with this kind of straightforward type inference without much trouble.
